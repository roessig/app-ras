# Applications of Robotics and Autonomous Systems
Two files of Python code which I created during this class: https://www.aot.tu-berlin.de/index.php?id=2887.
Further code cannot be uploaded due to license restrictions.

The overall project is a complex simulation environment for a smart factory, containing several autonomous robots. [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) is used as a framework and [MORSE](https://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/latest/morse.html) for the simulation of the factory.
My team and I worked on the task of multi agent path planning. The integration into the existing system was very difficult and successfully reached. Though, not all algorithmic ideas could be implemented.
